BIOGRAPHY
======
I will obtain my master's degree from the School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in June 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Mingjun Xiao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiaomj/  "the best tutor").  I am also fortunate to work with [Prof. Jie Wu](https://cis.temple.edu/~wu/) from Temple University. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Chongqing University (CQU) in 2021. I'm interested in smart city, mobile computing, cooperative perception, motion planning,  and distributed computing.
